                        <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>

                        <p>My long term goal is to build creative websites or software that help people. Whether I am
                        involved directly in coding, or perhaps project management, this path will be kickstarted after
                        EDA with a Junior Dev role, where I will be able to glean from the experiences of better
                        experienced Devs.</p>

                        <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at
                        EDA?</h3>

                        <p>Communication is key. I have experienced on many occasions how miscommunication in a team
                        environment has negatively affected productivity, and I am certainly no exception to causing
                        this. While at EDA I would like to focus on communicating problems clearly with team mates, and
                        working together to create solutions.</p>

                        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>

                        <p>I believe that I am a fairly open and approachable person, however sometimes I think that this
                        may not be how other people view me. As such, what could be a great strength in a team
                        environment becomes a limitation. This is something else that I would like to focus on while at
                        EDA: projecting myself as friendly and approachable.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
                        programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
                        productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
                        representatives.</h3>

                        <p>Being an empathetic listener and communicator will be key to success here. I can often get
                        caught up in my own interest. I will need to concentrate more on what others in my cohort are
                        going through, as well as facilitators and others in the industry.
                        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
                        When I need help I think it would be wise to first ask members of my cohort either on slack or
                        in person, as they may be, or may have, also been struggling with the same thing.</p>
                        
                        <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>

                        <p>It would be great to have the facilitation team on hand to help if myself and my peers are
                        stuck. I do not expect a facilitator to hand me a magical piece of perfect code when I need it,
                        but rather to offer support and point me in the right direction to find the answer myself.</p>
