                        <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>

                        <p>My long term goal is to build creative websites or software that help people. Whether I am
                            involved directly in coding, or perhaps project management, this path will be kickstarted
                            after
                            EDA with a Junior Dev role, where I will be able to glean from the experiences of better
                            experienced Devs.</p>

                        <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while
                            at
                            EDA?</h3>

                        <p>Communication is key. I have experienced on many occasions how miscommunication in a team
                            environment has negatively affected productivity, and I am certainly no exception to causing
                            this. While at EDA I would like to focus on communicating problems clearly with team mates,
                            and
                            working together to create solutions.</p>

                        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>

                        <p>I believe that I am a fairly open and approachable person, however sometimes I think that
                            this
                            may not be how other people view me. As such, what could be a great strength in a team
                            environment becomes a limitation. This is something else that I would like to focus on while
                            at
                            EDA: projecting myself as friendly and approachable.</p>

                        <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
                            programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
                            productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
                            representatives.</h3>

                        <p>Being an empathetic listener and communicator will be key to success here. I can often get
                            caught up in my own interest. I will need to concentrate more on what others in my cohort
                            are
                            going through, as well as facilitators and others in the industry.
                            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
                            When I need help I think it would be wise to first ask members of my cohort either on slack
                            or
                            in person, as they may be, or may have, also been struggling with the same thing.</p>

                        <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>

                        <p>It would be great to have the facilitation team on hand to help if myself and my peers are
                            stuck. I do not expect a facilitator to hand me a magical piece of perfect code when I need
                            it,
                            but rather to offer support and point me in the right direction to find the answer myself.
                        </p>
