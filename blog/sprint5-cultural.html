                        <h2>Core Reflections</h2>

                        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
                            core learning?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                When I come up against a challenge, an initial response is often to find the easiest
                                solution. Once realised, this can be harnessed for good. Someone once said laziness is
                                the father of innovation. So yes, look for an easy out, a quick solution, something
                                innovative, but most importantly, understand it, and make sure it bloody well works.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                It can be easy to beat yourself up when you can’t solve a problem. Sometimes you just
                                hit a wall and your mind goes blank. This happens, and it happens to everyone. But by
                                believing in Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset, you can attack problems with the belief
                                that if you keep pushing and keep trying, you will keep learning and developing, until
                                soon enough, that problem seems like the simplest of issues.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                Listening is hard. This was quite surprising. My girlfriend likes to tell me that I have
                                selective listening. I never believed her until I tried to listen to everything someone
                                had to say in two minutes. Having realised this after my first round of listening and
                                looping, I was far more attentive in my second round. I look forward to doing more in
                                bootcamp!
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                        <p>
                            With these attributes in mind, we can develop a holistic-of-sorts approach to learning and
                            programming. By understanding that we are all different, we all learn at different rates,
                            and we all have different perspectives, we can harness the knowledge and help of those
                            around us, and work as a team to aid in our own development. Taking in to account our own
                            personal values, and a self awareness of our strengths and limitations, we can identify
                            where and how we need to focus our time and energy, to help us learn and become better
                            programmers/
                        </p>
                        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Its relevance. It is very easy to pooh-pooh this kind of learning. “I already know how to
                            deal with people”,”I’ve worked in a professional capacity before”,”I know how to interview
                            for a job and not look like a complete recloose”. These things are easy to say, but it’s
                            harder to understand that we can always learn more about ourselves and those around us. Our
                            development as humans is never ending, we are not computers built to do exactly as a
                            function requires, but much more complex creatures, and it's worth spending time exploring
                            that.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Reflection. It’s always an easy one to skip. You finish a task and you’re eager to move on
                            to the next one. I am still very much guilty of this. But It takes reflection, such as
                            typing that last sentence out, to really understand. So have a break, have a kit-kat, and
                            reflect on what you’ve just done.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                            learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The cliche programmer sits in a dark room, ideally a windowless basement, of an office
                            building and has no social skills whatsoever. In 2020, this is most certainly not the case.
                            There is nothing wrong with being introverted and working autonomously, in many cases, that
                            works very well. But in order to work as part of a team, we need to be sociable and
                            understanding. This avoids conflict, and aids in effective communication, which of course
                            leads to great work.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                            have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Absolutely not. As I have highlighted above, I have learnt a lot from the core side of this
                            course. I look forward to more in bootcamp!
                        </p>

                        <h2>Learning Reflections</h2>

                        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

                        <p>
                            I would love to be able to leverage my skills learned at DevAcademy for social enterprise. I
                            absolutely
                            believe that coding can be used to positivly impact real-world problems. However to get to
                            this point,
                            I would love to have to opportunity to work at a company or agency for a few years in order
                            to
                            develop more as a coder and learn from senior devs, and new challenges.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>

                        <p>
                            I believe that once I get going, I can problem solve relatively well and write code,
                            however, a weakness I face is breaking a large project in to smaller functions to work on.
                            When looking at the bigger picture, I find it difficult to imagine how the code would be
                            written
                            to solve the problems. I think that a lot of help in this area will come from my peers and
                            also
                            from guidance from tech facilitators. In saying that, it will also be down to me to
                            acknowledge
                            this limitation and work to overcome it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I will also need to make sure I take plenty of breaks away from the computer.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>

                        <p>
                            Nine weeks is a long time. Being away from my partner will be difficult. But I do not
                            see that as becoming a major issue. Long days will be tough for me, but I understand Why
                            they are needed, and that ultimately, nine weeks is not a long time at all, compared to a
                            lifelong career. So its time to knuckle down, stop messing about, and crack on with it.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while
                            at
                            EDA?</h3>

                        <p>
                            I would like to work on communication. I don't think im a difficult person to work with, but
                            I do think
                            my communication skills could be worked on. When communicating an issue to a colleague, I
                            often think that
                            my explanation is not clear enough for them to understand the problem. As such, I would like
                            to work on
                            clear communication. I tend to waffle, but waffles are delicious, so it's not all bad.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>

                        <p>
                            I will try my hardest to solve an issue myself, but it would be worthwhile having a self
                            imposed timebox to work on issues,
                            If I need help, I will ask my peers. Discussing issues together will my closely simulte a
                            working environment, and it
                            creates a learning opportunity for all. Following this, technical advisors will be the next
                            resource. With more experience,
                            they hold a wealth of knowledge that is there for the taking.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should
                            include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely
                            with
                            other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>

                        <p>
                            Focus on the task at hand. Having a set daily routine and being in a working environment
                            will aid productivity,
                            but it will also be important to recognise stress and feelings of being over worked. As
                            such, it will be vital to
                            take frequent small breaks. Full participation in core and extracurricular activites such as
                            yoga (Shoulder dependant), and
                            going for a beer with other students will be essential as well. Not only to ease stress, but
                            also to create a bond with fellow
                            students that will help in the working environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most importantly - Go for a walk, get some fresh air, vitamin D, good healthy food, and
                            plenty of sleep. It's a marathon, not a sprint!
                        </p>
