                        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
                            core learning?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                When I come up against a challenge, an initial response is often to find the easiest
                                solution. Once realised, this can be harnessed for good. Someone once said laziness is
                                the father of innovation. So yes, look for an easy out, a quick solution, something
                                innovative, but most importantly, understand it, and make sure it bloody well works.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                It can be easy to beat yourself up when you can’t solve a problem. Sometimes you just
                                hit a wall and your mind goes blank. This happens, and it happens to everyone. But by
                                believing in Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset, you can attack problems with the belief
                                that if you keep pushing and keep trying, you will keep learning and developing, until
                                soon enough, that problem seems like the simplest of issues. 
                            </li><br>

                                Listening is hard. This was quite surprising. My girlfriend likes to tell me that I have
                                selective listening. I never believed her until I tried to listen to everything someone
                                had to say in two minutes. Having realised this after my first round of listening and
                                looping, I was far more attentive in my second round. I look forward to doing more in
                                bootcamp!

                        <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                        <p>
                            With these attributes in mind, we can develop a holistic-of-sorts approach to learning and
                            programming. By understanding that we are all different, we all learn at different rates,
                            and we all have different perspectives, we can harness the knowledge and help of those
                            around us, and work as a team to aid in our own development. Taking in to account our own
                            personal values, and a self awareness of our strengths and limitations, we can identify
                            where and how we need to focus our time and energy, to help us learn and become better
                            programmers/
                        </p>
                        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Its relevance. It is very easy to pooh-pooh this kind of learning. “I already know how to
                            deal with people”,”I’ve worked in a professional capacity before”,”I know how to interview
                            for a job and not look like a complete recloose”. These things are easy to say, but it’s
                            harder to understand that we can always learn more about ourselves and those around us. Our
                            development as humans is never ending, we are not computers built to do exactly as a
                            function requires, but much more complex creatures, and it's worth spending time exploring
                            that.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Reflection. It’s always an easy one to skip. You finish a task and you’re eager to move on
                            to the next one. I am still very much guilty of this. But It takes reflection, such as
                            typing that last sentence out, to really understand. So have a break, have a kit-kat, and
                            reflect on what you’ve just done. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                            learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The cliche programmer sits in a dark room, ideally a windowless basement, of an office
                            building and has no social skills whatsoever. In 2020, this is most certainly not the case.
                            There is nothing wrong with being introverted and working autonomously, in many cases, that
                            works very well. But in order to work as part of a team, we need to be sociable and
                            understanding. This avoids conflict, and aids in effective communication, which of course
                            leads to great work.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                            have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Absolutely not. As I have highlighted above, I have learnt a lot from the core side of this
                            course. I look forward to more in bootcamp!
