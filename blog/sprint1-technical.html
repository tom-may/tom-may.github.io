                        <p>Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies.
                            One morning his mother
                            wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te
                            Kao, a short distance
                            away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to
                            annoy some Te Rarawa people
                            who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing
                            the journey over the
                            hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to
                            heat up properly. On
                            reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet
                            potatoes) situated at the
                            foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai
                            (food). He was immediately recognised.
