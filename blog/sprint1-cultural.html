                <h2>An introduction to reflection</h2>
                <h3>10 November 2020</h3>

                        <p>When planning a hike through Nepal, my girlfriend and I were faced with a decision; Do we
                            hire a
                            guide, or do we self-direct?</p>

                        <p>With this came many more questions:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Is it ethical to have someone carry our bags for what is to us such a tiny expense?</li>
                            <li>Where are we going? Can we do it ourselves? Is it ethical and safe to do it ourselves?
                            </li>
                            <li>Who benefits from our decision?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Ultimately, we decided to hike in a restricted area of the Himalayas that required a guide,
                            but
                            what about a porter to carry the bags as was offered by the tour guide? Well, we decided to
                            get
                            a porter too. However, while hiking we loaded our own bags with as much of our heavy gear as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>At the end of our 18 day hike through Nepal, I am very glad that we made the decision to hire
                            both a guide and a porter. Along the way we met a hiker who was determined to “conquer the
                            mountains” themselves, and was determined not to hire a guide or porter, despite warnings
                            from
                            locals about dangers on the trail. To each their own, but I believe that when travelling you
                            gain so much through new experiences, and as a visitor to someone else's home, you are
                            ultimately a tax on their resources in one way or another. Because of this, you have a
                            responsibility to contribute what you can for the betterment of that society.</p>

                        <p>By engaging with a local hiking tour company and hiring a local guide and porter from the
                            area
                            in which we hiked, we contributed as much as we could directly to the area that we visited.

                        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>

                        <p>I now understand just how much of a privileged upbringing I have had, in a global context.
                            Growing up in New Zealand it was so easy to take what we have here for granted. As a young
                            nation and a cultural melting pot, we have a wonderful affinity for both acceptance of
                            people
                            from different backgrounds, and a connection to the outdoors, as well as a natural intrigue
                            for
                            what's beyond the horizon (both geographically and figuratively).</p>

                        <p>This is how I grew up and what shaped me as a young person. By going out into the big bad
                            world,
                            I gleaned from the varied experiences and ideas of others that I met along the way. I’m
                            still
                            growing, but I think I'm on the right track.</p>

                        <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
                        </h3>

                        <p>One strength that I think is very beneficial is that I am aware that I know nothing. I have a
                            lot to learn and a lot of great people out there to learn from. As such, I am a sponge,
                            ready to
                            soak up all the knowledge I can.</p>

                        <p>A limitation is my ability to stay focused on a goal. Although adapting and pivoting to a new
                            goal is often beneficial, when it comes to learning, I need a pretty rigid structure. This
                            is
                            where EDA comes in. I also often fail to reflect on my learnings and tend to move to the
                            next
                            task pretty quickly. As such, I need to focus on prioritizing and accounting for proper
                            reflection time.</p>

                        <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might
                            intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>

                        <p>Another of my strengths is passion. I tend to get very excited and swept up with an idea that
                            grasps my attention. This will be very advantageous when working on personal projects.
                            However,
                            when I hit a creative block, this can become an obstacle. When I struggle, my passion wanes.
                            I
                            just need to remember to take a step back and look at the ’why’ I am doing this task. That
                            will
                            spark my motivation!</p>
