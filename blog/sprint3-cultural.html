                        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence? </h3>

                        <p>Emotional Intelligence is having the ability to recognise and understand your actions and
                            feelings as they occur, in real time. Emotional Intelligence does not only relate to the
                            self, but also to how others feel, and how you respond to that.</p>

                        <p>Emotional Intelligence can be a complex and at times difficult concept to understand and
                            implement, and this is because we humans and the way our minds work are very complex. By
                            understanding the five pillars of Emotional Intelligence, this can be much easier. They are:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Self-Awareness</strong></p>

                                <p>People with high EI are usually very self-aware. They understand their emotions and
                                    how their actions affect others.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Self-Regulation</strong></p>

                                <p>This is the ability to monitor and control our own behavior, emotions, or thoughts,
                                    and alter them depending on the situation.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>

                                <p>People with a high degree of EI are usually motivated. They're willing to defer
                                    immediate results for long-term success.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Empathy</strong></p>

                                <p>Being aware of the feelings and emotions of other people. You can place yourself in
                                    their shoes and feel what they are feeling.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Social skills</strong></p>

                                <p>People who are emotionally intelligent are able to build rapport and trust quickly
                                    with others on their teams</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>


                        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>

                        <p>Emotional Intelligence is defined as an individual's ability to identify, evaluate, control,
                            and express emotions. By having the ability to understand, empathize, and connect with
                            people, those with high Emotional Intelligence are usually great leaders, team players and
                            just plain old great to be around.</p>

                        <p>IQ (Intelligence quotient), is a score derived from one of several standardized tests
                            designed to assess an individual's intelligence. It is used to determine academic abilities
                            and identify individuals with off-the-chart intelligence or mental challenges.
                            Emotional Intelligence is a better indicator of success in the workplace and is used to
                            identify leaders, good team players, and people who best work by themselves.</p>

                        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>

                        <p>Not only will Emotional Intelligence help you achieve success in your career, it will also
                            help you to become a stronger and happier individual. Once you are able to identify and
                            control your emotions, you will no longer be led astray by feelings of anger, grief,
                            frustration and sadness. The mind is a muscle, and like all other muscles, it can be
                            trained. When we recognise undesirable feelings and understand why we feel such a way, we
                            can identify ways to change how we feel for the better, and we can be happy.</p>
