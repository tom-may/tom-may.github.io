                        <h3>HTML and CSS - In human terms</h3>

                        <p>Once upon a time, in a black and white village far far away, a priest and a mason were
                            building a chapel. They had built the foundations using brick and mortar (html). There was
                            an entryway (header), a prayer room (body), and a room out back for the priest (footer).
                            Within each of these sections, were nested more elements, such as; tables, pews, altar.
                        </p>

                        <p>They were very happy with the result, although it was nothing special, when one day who
                            should enter but the medieval queer eye for the straight mason crew. With a dash of their
                            style (css), they began to add color to the window panes (color/background-color), intricate
                            design to the stone (font), and rearranged the layout of the church rooms for a more
                            balanced Feng Shui (grid/box model).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And so, css linked to html to design a spectacular new chapel (website)
                        </p>

                        <h3>Control flow - It's just like a shopping list:</h3>

                        <p>Control flow is the order in which code is run, and code runs from top to bottom, plain and
                            simple. Except it’s not so plain and simple. Code will always be filled with wonderful
                            things called conditionals and loops. These structures have the availability to change
                            control flow.
                        </p>

                        <p>Let's look at an example - a trip to the supermarket.</p>

                        <p>To help us understand control flow, I’m going to explain our trip to the supermarket using a
                            for...in loop. A for..in loop is used when dealing with a variable that is an object. I’ll
                            have more information on an object for you later, but for now, all we need to know is that
                            an object is essentially a list, much like a shopping list. In this list we have properties,
                            and these are made of keys and values. In our shopping list, our key is the fruit that we
                            need, and the value would be the number of fruit we need. It might look like this:</p>

                        <p>Var shoppingList = {<br>
                            Apples : 6,<br>
                            Bananas : 4,<br>
                            Oranges : 64<br>
                            } </p>

                        <p>Now that’s a lot of oranges.</p>

                        <p>So we have our object, but what about the juicy for...in loop. Well, it works like this:</p>

                        <p>for (Apple in shoppingList) {<br>
                            Add 6 Apples to shoppingCart<br>
                            }</p>

                        <p>It will run through the list, see we need apples, see that we need 6 apples, and it will add
                            6 apples to our shopping cart.</p>

                        <p>Then it will run again, doing the same for bananas:</p>

                        <p>for (Banana in shoppingList) { <br>
                            Add 4 bananas to shoppingCart<br>
                            }</p>

                        <p>And it will do this until it reaches the end of our shopping list. I wish shopping was this
                            easy, but I do hope it doesn’t pick any brown bananas…</p>

                        <p>But what about control flow? What has this got to do with the order in which code is run?</p>

                        <p>Well, imagine the first thing we do in the morning is eatFruit. What if eatFruit is not
                            possible because there is no fruit? Well then we would goShoppingForFruit, where we would
                            use our shoppingList.</p>

                        <p>As you can see, this would put our shoppingList pretty high up on our day of code, way above
                            eatLunch. But what if we do have Fruit? Then we would eatFruit && beHappy. Our shoppingList
                            loop would be ignored and we would go on with our day happily filled with fruit. Control
                            Flow.</p>

                        <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>

                        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is essentially the glue that holds HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                            together. </p>

                        <p>The DOM is made up of two important features:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Objects</strong> - These are all of the properties, methods and events available
                                for creating and manipulating webpages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nodes</strong> - EVERYTHING. They are every little bit of a document. In an HTML
                                doc, we can have, text nodes, attribute nodes, id or class class nodes.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>These two important distinctions can allow us to do whatever we please to a webpage. For
                            example, we may have some text (node) that says “Howdy, stranger!”, followed by a text box
                            with a prompt to write in your own name, and a submit button, which gives us a new node of
                            the submitted name. Using the DOM, we can get JavaScript to take the submitted name node,
                            and replace the original text node in our HTML document to say:“Howdy, Your Majesty!”
                            (Presuming the Queen visits our page).</p>

                        <h3>Arrays and Objects - and how do we crack open the coconut to access their sweet sweet
                            water(data).</h3>

                        <p><strong>Objects</strong> (sound familiar?) are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That
                            could be a person, a car, a <em>shoppingList</em>. Basically objects can be defined by a set
                            of characteristics called properties, made up of a key and a value.</p>

                        <p>To access data in an object, we can use . or [ ].</p>
                        <p>To get info on our shoppingList we would code:</p>

                        <p>Dot notation:</p>
                        <p>shoppingList.apples - which will return 6</p>

                        <p>Or</p>

                        <p>Bracket notation:</p>
                        <p>shoppingList['apples'] - which again will return 6</p>


                        <p><strong>Arrays</strong> on the other hand, are lists that contain a single variable. As such,
                            a shoppingList Array would simply look like (apples,timtams,bananas,oranges,)</p>

                        <p>Let’s say our shoppingList is ordered by level of importance, and we for some odd reason
                            would like to know what our second most important piece of produce to purchase is.
                            Well then, it is important to know that Arrays always use zero-based indexing. This means
                            that the first item on our list is associated with 0, the next 1, then 2, 3,4 and so on and
                            so forth.</p>

                        <p>So, if we want to access the information of our second most important item from the
                            supermarket (and the nation's favourite biscuit). We write:</p>

                        <p>shoppingListArray[1]; which returns timtams! Woohoo.</p>

                        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>

                        <p>What is a function? Well, most importantly, a function is a reusable piece of code.
                            Essentially, we can write a piece of code, give it a name, and use it as much as we like by
                            calling its name. This can save a lot of time and energy, as we don't have to write the code
                            out again, we just call the function! woohoo!</p>
