                        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>

                        <p>
                            This week was an interesting one for me. I really enjoyed working through the kata’s, getting
                            stuck, working towards a solution..., and BAM! You try a bit of code and it works! WooHoo!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But not only did I have to face the challenges of Javascript, but also the challenge of
                            dislocating my shoulder. Ouchies. (It’s the fourth time it’s happened, so it happens pretty
                            easily now.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Funnily enough though, there are some similarities between dislocating your shoulder and
                            getting blocked on a coding challenge. You have that initial “Oh cr*p” moment, and then you
                            have to breathe, stop and think, ok, this has happened, what are my next steps. The solution
                            to the problem is getting to the hospital, but there are a bunch of smaller steps that need
                            to be taken first in order to achieve this goal. So you need a plan. I dislocated my
                            shoulder at the pool while putting on my t-shirt after a swim (I told you it happens
                            easily), so first of all I needed to get a lifeguard, then I needed to take of my t-shirt
                            which was only half on, then get someone to go to my car to get my phone so that I could
                            tell my girlfriend to meet me at the hospital. I then needed the lifeguard to drive my car
                            to the hospital. Lots of steps to go through, all while thinking “OH F…….” 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If there’s anything to be learnt from this experience, it’s that solving a problem requires
                            calm, and quite often, help from others. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So when it came to finding Scooby, it required a lot of calm when I thought “oh cr*p”. I
                            honestly had no idea where to begin. Hold up, what about console.logging? Let's take a look
                            at what's coming through here. Right, an array. And what's in the array? An object? Ok let's
                            Pseudocode and write down what to do from here. Now what about .find()? Lets try some
                            googling?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Eventually, after a fair amount of research, guided by an understanding of exactly what I
                            wanted to achieve, thanks to Pseudocode and rubber ducking, I wrote a piece of code that
                            console.logged the ‘Scooby’ objects. From there it was a simple if statement to grab the
                            door number. What a relief. Just like when the shoulder goes back in :D
                        </p>

                        <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>

                        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
                        <p>
                            Love it. Every time I face a challenge I begin by writing some Pseudocode. I even put pen to
                            paper from the most part because I’m old school like that.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Trying something</h3>
                        <p>
                            Always give something a try. It may not work at all, it may work in part, or it may be the
                            solution. You won’t know until you try.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
                        <p>
                            I don’t have a rubber duck, but I do have a tiny plastic mouse holding a lightbulb. He’s
                            great, we’re pals. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
                        <p>
                            Absolutely. Sometimes they can seem like gibberish, but for the most part, they let me know
                            my syntax is wrong
                        </p>
                        <h3>Console.logging</h3>
                        <p>
                            Love love LOVE!
                        </p>
                        <h3>Googling</h3>
                        <a href='https://askjeeves.net/'>Ask Jeeves</a>
                        <p>
                            How good. If you’ve got a problem, someone else has already solved it and posted about it
                            online.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
                        <p>
                            We are all in this together, so we can all help each other learn. Everyone sees things
                            differently, so we can all benefit from another's perspective
                        </p>
                        <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
                        <p>
                            I’m gonna rely on this a lot during bootcamp I think, but for now I’m trying to get cosy with
                            most other techniques.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                        <p>
                            It can be hard to spend ample time reflecting at the moment, although I have been having some
                            coding dreams lately. I’m really looking forward to having a good amount of time to reflect
                            in the time before bootcamp.
