                        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

                        <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>

                        <p>
                            Simply put, Neuroplasticity is our brain's ability to adapt. By forming new pathways in our
                            brain through learning, our brain changes, and adapts to new information. Our brain is
                            malleable. So how can we utilise this to help aid our change?
                            The first step to utilising this awesome power, is to understand what Neuroplasticity is. I
                            think, therefore I am. I understand neuroplasticity, therefore I can use it to change my
                            mindset and continue to grow. Awareness = endless possibility
                            Neuroplasticity requires effort, so the old adage of “practice makes perfect” really holds
                            true. With the knowledge that our brains can change and develop, no matter the stage of our
                            lives, we can go forth in our lives with the knowledge that if we continue to push ourselves
                            in our learning, we will continue to grow, and success is within our reach
                        </p>

                        <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            While learning to code, I believe it will be fundamental to practice coding as much as
                            possible,
                            ideally every day. Neuroplasticity is not just about forming strong pathways in your brain,
                            but
                            it also describes that a lack of training can weaken these pathways. I have seen this
                            directly
                            when learning to touch type. If I practice for an hour every day, my competency improves at
                            a
                            steady rate, however, if I miss one or two days, I am set back from where I was before, and
                            it
                            takes time to catch up to the level I was at previously.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>

                        <p>
                            Practice, practice, practice - You need to keep on working and keep on challenging yourself.
                            The
                            more difficult the task, the greater the scope of learning potential. If you keep on doing
                            easy
                            challenges, sure it feels great to tick them off one by one, but you don’t really improve
                            your
                            learning.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thinking about code and about challenges can also be beneficial. Just like visualizing a
                            golf
                            swing, or a line down the mountain on your snowboard can help when it comes to actually
                            doing
                            the activity, the same can be said for learning. Visualise and think about code after you
                            have
                            studied.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Just as visualisation and mental exercises help, reflection is also a great tool. So keep on
                            reflecting after the fact.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

                        <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>

                        <p>
                            Growth Mindset goes hand in hand with Neuroplasticity. Our brains are malleable and always
                            changing. This is promoted even further by having a growth mindset. By understanding that we
                            can
                            continue to develop our brains by being open to change, we can work hard at achieving our
                            goals,
                            rather than just throwing in the towel when things get too challenging. If we believe that
                            our
                            brain development is fixed, we believe that we have already achieved a level of intelligence
                            that is now fixed and unable to grow. With a growth mindset we believe that anything is
                            possible
                            if we work hard at it. Granted, everybody is different, being at different levels of growth,
                            with different methods that work for development, but at the end of the day, when we know
                            that
                            we can grow, and we do not hold ourselves back, our possibilities become endless
                        </p>

                        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>

                        <p>
                            I found the case studies of classrooms in inner-city and indigenous regions of America to be
                            quite fascinating. To see such stark results after only one year was very impressive. I have
                            believed for a while now that anyone can achieve what they want when they work hard at it,
                            but
                            to now see studies proving so is absolutely awesome. It’s great to now have a name for it,
                            and a
                            better understanding so that I can focus on certain methods to improve my own learning.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>

                        <p>By not being too critical of myself when my learning takes slower than I initially expected.
                            By
                            facing challenges with an understanding that the more difficult they are, the greater my
                            learning potential. By not being idle in my work and reminding myself to keep trying new
                            things
                            and developing more. It is not the result that matters most, but the process by which the
                            result
                            was achieved.
